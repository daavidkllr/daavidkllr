Welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

<br/>
<p>
    Hi, I am David! <br/>
    I'm a 23 y.o professional full-stack web developer from :de: with 7 years experience in building scalable web applications.</p>
<p>
    I started getting passionate about developing at the age of 16. <br>First I started some simple websites and since then I kept learning day by day on my own until now.
</p>
<p>
    I take care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build. <br>Everything getting checked twice, a good and clean code is the foundation for every growing project. <br>I am familiar with the common principles and code patterns and try to adhere to them as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Last but no least, I take everything with humour, I like to work with young and crazy people. ðŸ¤ª.
</p>
